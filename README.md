# Fileshare

A simple and secure file sharing solution that allows you to share files without relying on external cloud storage services.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal file storage and sharing platform where you can:
- Store files without uploading them to third-party cloud services
- Share files directly through Git-based version control
- Maintain complete control over your data and privacy
- Access your files from anywhere with Git access

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload Files**: Add your files to this repository
2. **Commit & Push**: Use Git to version control and sync your files
3. **Share**: Share the repository link or specific file links with others
4. **Access**: Download files directly from the repository

## 📁 File Organization

- Store files in organized folders based on type or purpose
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Consider file size limitations of Git repositories

## 🔧 Usage

### Adding Files
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Fileshare

# Add your files
cp /path/to/your/file ./

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add [file description]"
git push origin main
```

### Sharing Files
- **Direct Link**: Share the raw file URL from GitHub/GitLab
- **Repository Access**: Give others read access to the repository
- **Download**: Others can clone the repository or download individual files

### Downloading Files
```bash
# Clone entire repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Or download individual files using wget/curl
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/Fileshare/main/filename.ext
```

## 📋 Best Practices

- **File Size**: Keep files under 100MB (Git's recommended limit)
- **Binary Files**: Use Git LFS for large binary files if needed
- **Organization**: Create folders for different file types or projects
- **Descriptions**: Use meaningful commit messages when adding files
- **Security**: Don't store sensitive or private information

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- This is a Git-based solution - consider repository visibility settings
- Files are stored in version control, making them traceable
- Use private repositories for sensitive content
- Consider encryption for highly sensitive files before adding them

## 🛠️ Git LFS Setup (for large files)

If you need to store files larger than 100MB:

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track large file types
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.dmg"

# Add and commit .gitattributes
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add Git LFS tracking"
```
